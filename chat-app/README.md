## 📌 Project Overview
A sophisticated backend engine that supports real-time communication across multiple client types. This project demonstrates a "Hybrid" approach, ensuring high-speed data delivery via WebSockets while maintaining backward compatibility through HTTP Long Polling.

## **Project Origin**
I built this project as part of the **CodeYourFuture** curriculum. I moved it to this standalone repository to highlight the technical architecture and provide a clear view of the final product.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

### **Backend (Server-Side)**
*   **Node.js**: The runtime environment used to execute JavaScript on the server.
*   **Express.js**: The web framework used to build the RESTful API and manage middleware.
*   **WebSockets (ws/wss)**: Used to establish a persistent, bidirectional communication pipe for real-time updates.
*   **CORS**: Middleware used to allow secure cross-origin communication between the frontend and backend.

### **Frontend (Client-Side)**
*   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**: Used for DOM manipulation, event handling, and managing the WebSocket lifecycle.
*   **HTML5 & CSS3**: Used to structure and style the chat interface.
*   **Fetch API**: Used for standard HTTP POST requests to send messages and reactions.

### **Tools & Dev Ops**
*   **NPM**: Used for package management.
*   **JSON**: The data format used for the custom "Command Pattern" protocol.
*   **Git/GitHub**: Version control and documentation.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Dual-Mode Broadcasting:** Engineered a server that simultaneously pushes updates to WebSocket "pipes" and handles "waiting" Long Polling requests.
- **State Reconciliation (Catch-up):** Implemented logic using `?since=` query parameters to automatically synchronize chat history for users who connect late or experience network flickers.
- **Live Reactions:** Real-time Like and Dislike functionality with an "Absolute Total" update strategy to ensure UI consistency across all connected sessions.
- **Command Pattern Protocol:** Designed a structured message format (`command` and `payload`) to allow the frontend to distinguish between new messages and reaction updates over a single stream.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- **Protocol Management:** I learned the fundamental differences between the HTTP Long Polling and the WebSockets, and how to make them coexist on a single server.
- **Middleware & Safety:** Building custom middlewares taught me the importance of the `next()` function and how to use `try/catch` blocks to protect the server from malformed user data.
- **Architectural Refactoring:** I reorganized my backend by moving complicated logic into small, reusable helper functions. I also learned to handle errors right at the start of a function (the 'Early Return' style), which keeps the code flat and much easier to read.


## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Iswanna/Module-Decomposition.git
   ```
2. **Navigate into the project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd chat-app
   ```
3. **Switch to the branch with my work:**
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/chat-app
   ```
4. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
5. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
6. **Open the App:**
   Open `frontend-polling/index.html` (for long-polling) or `frontend-websocket/index.html` (for WebSockets) in your browser.
